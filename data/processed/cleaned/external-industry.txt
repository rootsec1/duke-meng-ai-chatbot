Industry and Employer Relations
Recruit or work with top talent skilled in solving problems using AI, machine learning and data analytics
At Duke Engineering’s Master of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence program, we develop future technology leaders who can combine their domain expertise with an interdisciplinary set of skills in AI and machine learning to build and improve products and services.
Building upon a strong engineering and science foundation, our students gain skills in three core competency areas:

Theory and practice of AI and machine learning
Business, legal and ethical context for developing new analytics products

We welcome organizations of all industries, types and sizes to engage with our talented students for both recruiting and to support our educational mission.
