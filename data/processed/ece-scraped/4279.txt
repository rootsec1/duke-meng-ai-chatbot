**Abstract:**

**Securing Signals from Unintended Eavesdroppers**

Protecting signals from eavesdropping is critical in the Internet-of-Things era. This seminar examines signal processing challenges that are difficult without key side information.

Exploiting resolution limits in compressed sensing, the research aims to create an environment where eavesdropping algorithms would fail. The intended receiver overcomes this ill-posed problem with secret side information shared between the transmitter and receiver.

Two scenarios are considered:

* Private communication using a novel block-sparsity based signaling strategy
* Private localization using structured noise to degrade the eavesdropper's channel

The amount of secret information required is modest, with theoretical guarantees and numerical validation.
