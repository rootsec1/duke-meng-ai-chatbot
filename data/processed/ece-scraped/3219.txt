**ECE SEMINAR**

**Title:** TinyML with Event-Driven Neuromorphic Sensors

**Presenter:** Shih-Chii Liu, Professor in the Faculty of Science at the University of Zurich

**Date:** Friday, November 20, 2020

**Time:** 7:00AM - 8:00AM

**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in neuromorphic event-driven Dynamic Audio Sensor (DAS) and Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) technologies, coupled with versatile hardware platforms like FPGAs, have enabled the determination of power-latency tradeoffs for various deep network architectures and feature representations before ASIC chip design and fabrication.

Event-driven sensors facilitate always-on sensing, enabling lower-latency system-level response times and reduced power consumption compared to conventional sampled sensors for simple Internet of Things (IoT) tasks.

This talk explores brain-inspired event-driven deep neural network architectures that leverage spatial and temporal sparsity. The impact of these bio-inspired architectures on TinyML system throughput and latency specifications when combined with DAS and DVS will be discussed, along with system performance in various audio and vision tasks.
