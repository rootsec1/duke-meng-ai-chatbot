# Minor in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence

## Overview

This minor is an outgrowth of Duke ECE's global research leadership in AI and machine learning. It requires the completion of a minimum of five (5) technical courses.

## Requirements

### Pre-requisites

* Mid-level programming course (e.g., CS 201)
* Linear algebra (e.g., Math 216, 218, 218D-2, 221)
* Introductory statistics (e.g., EGR 238L, ECE 380, ECE 555, Stat/Math 230, Stat 240L)

### Detailed Requirements

**Fundamental Courses** (Required)
* Intermediate Statistics/Probability—ECE 480: Applied Probability for Statistical Learning
* Introductory Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence—ECE 580: Introduction to Machine Learning
* Intermediate Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence course—ECE 682D/CS 571D/Stat 561D or ECE 687D/CS 671D/STA 671D

**Upper-Level Focus Courses** (Choose two)
* ECE 585: Signal Detection and Extraction Theory
* ECE 588: Image & Video Processing
* ECE 661: Computer Engineering Machine Learning & Deep Neural Networks
* ECE 662: Machine Learning Acceleration & Neuromorphic Computing
* ECE 684: Natural Language Processing
* ECE 685D: Deep Learning
* CompSci 527: Computer Vision
* Math 412: Topological Data Analysis
* Math 465/CompSci 445: Introduction to High Dimensional Data Analysis

* ME 555 (F23): Robot Learning 
* BME 590 (F23): Machine Learning in Pharmacology
* ECE 590: Special Topics courses on machine learning and artificial intelligence topics (with DUS approval)

## Important Notes

* Courses used to fulfill the student's major(s) may not be double-counted toward the minor.
* Courses with content substantially equivalent to courses in the student's major(s) may not be counted toward the minor.
* Students with credit for any of the Fundamental Courses may substitute additional Upper-Level Focus courses from the approved list above. The Director of Undergraduate Studies in ECE must approve such exceptions.
* At most, one Independent Study course may be used to fulfill one of the upper-level elective requirements.
