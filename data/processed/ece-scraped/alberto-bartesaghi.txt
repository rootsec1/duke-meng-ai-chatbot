## Biography

Dr. Bartesaghi is an Associate Professor in the departments of Computer Science, Biochemistry and Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University. The Bartesaghi Lab focuses on developing machine learning approaches to determine the structure of macromolecular complexes of general biomedical interest using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, cryo-electron tomography, and sub-volume averaging. Some of their targets include:

- glycoproteins of enveloped viruses like HIV, Influenza, and Ebola
- transporters and channels involved in signaling and metabolism
- GPCRs
- DNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas surveillance complexes
- targets for cancer drugs

The lab also works more broadly in the fields of:

- deep learning and artificial intelligence
- computer vision
- biomedical imaging
- high-performance computing
