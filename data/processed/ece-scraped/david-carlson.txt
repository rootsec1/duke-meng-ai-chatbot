David Carlson
Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering

My general research focus is on developing novel machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques that can be used to accelerate scientific discovery. I work extensively both on the fundamental theory and algorithms as well as translating them into scientific applications. I have extensive partnerships deploying machine learning techniques in environmental health, mental health, and neuroscience.
