**DMI/MRS Seminar**

**Date:** Thursday, December 1, 2022

**Time:** 5:00PM - 6:00PM

**Presenter:** Laura Dalton

**Abstract:**

* **Research Goal:** Study and understand reactive, multiphase transport in porous materials, especially in engineered (cementitious) and natural (geological) materials.

* **Imaging Techniques:**
    * X-ray computed tomography (CT)
    * Neutron tomography
    * Electrical imaging modalities
    * Simultaneous imaging

* **Application of Imaging:**
    * Study changes in porous materials over time (four-dimensional, 4D)
    * Characterize pore size distribution evolution
    * Quantify the kinetics of water sorption in cement-based materials
    * Study reactive transport in cement-based and geological materials used for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)

* **Benefits of 4D Imaging:**
    * Provides a powerful tool to understand material properties and behavior
    * Enables the development of new materials
