ECE SEMINAR: Introduction to SRAM Design

November 4, 2021
8:00 am - 9:15 am

Presenter: Pramod Kolar

Abstract:
This talk covers memory design in advanced process technologies. We will discuss challenges designers face and creative solutions developed over the years. There will be a brief discussion of the various trade-offs in power, performance and area (PPA) that designers have to make to optimize memory offerings. We will touch upon some advanced circuit techniques to address aggressive voltage scaling requirements.
