**Requirements**

The general requirements and departmental requirements for a B.S.E. with the electrical and computer engineering major requires the completion of 34 distinct courses composed of:

* **Writing:** WRITING 101, during the first academic year
* **Engineering Computation:** EGR 101L, during the first semester
* **Humanities/Social Sciences:** 5 elective courses, appropriately distributed
* **Mathematics and Probability/Statistics:** A 6-course sequence:
    * MATH 111L, 112L, and (212, 216, and 353 -- for those who matriculated before Fall 2021, OR 218D-2, 219, and 353 -- for those who matriculated in Fall 2021 or later)
    * A Statistics Elective: one of {STA 130, STA 240L, MATH 230, Math 231, Math 340, EGR 238L, ECE 380, or ECE 555}
* **Natural Sciences:** 3 courses:
    * CHEM 20, 21, or 101DL
    * PHYSICS 151L and 152L
* **Electrical Engineering:** 5 foundation courses:
    * ECE 110L, 230L, 250D, 270DL, and 280L
* **ECE Concentration Electives:** 4 approved electives, in two different areas with at least two courses in one of the elected areas
* **ECE Extension Elective:** 1 elective course at the 300-level or above from:
    * A 300-level (or above) course from the departments of Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Evolutionary Anthropology, Mathematics, Physics, Psychology & Neuroscience, or Statistical Science that has an NS or QS code (and does not have an SS code)
    * An upper-level (300-level or above) course from ECE, BME, MEMS, or CEE
    * BIOLOGY 201L, 202L, 203L, 275A, CHEM 201DL, 202DL, or 210DL, or PHYS 264L
* **ECE Elective Course:** 1 elective ECE course at the 300-level or above
* **ECE Design Elective:** 1 approved ECE Design Elective
* **Free Electives:** 4 Free Electives

**Notes:**

* An elective course that belongs to more than one requirements category may be counted only once.
* For students who matriculated Fall 2017 or earlier:
    * 1 Natural Science/Engineering elective is accepted in lieu of EGR 101L
    * 2 Elective ECE Courses at the 300-level or above are required instead of taking 1 ECE Elective and 1 ECE Extension Elective

**Sample 4+1: BSE/Master's Program**

Students may accelerate their studies to complete a BSE degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering in four years and a Master's degree at the end of a fifth year. Interested students should consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies and the Director of Graduate Studies to develop an appropriate academic plan.
