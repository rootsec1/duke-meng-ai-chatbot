Abstract:
Recent advances in medical imaging technologies have led to an increased demand for effective medical image analysis methods. Deep learning (DL) approaches have demonstrated promising results in this field, outperforming traditional image analysis techniques. However, medical image analysis presents several unique challenges compared to natural scene image analysis. Firstly, it often requires large amounts of annotated data for model training. Secondly, medical images can be 2D, 3D, or even higher dimensional, with 3D medical images posing significant challenges for deep learning methods due to their large size and limited GPU memory. Thirdly, annotating medical images is a costly and labor-intensive process, as it requires specialized expertise.

In this talk, we present new DL-based sparse annotation approaches for 3D medical image segmentation. Image segmentation aims to identify target objects in images and is a crucial task in medical image analysis. Our approaches combine DL methods with algorithmic techniques to address the annotation challenges. We utilize sparse annotation schemes that judiciously select representative samples for annotation. Furthermore, finding an optimal subset of samples to represent an entire image dataset as sparse training data is an NP-hard problem, which our approaches solve approximately while ensuring good quality. Our methods achieve strong performance even with very small annotation ratios (e.g., 3%-15%). Notably, when utilizing full annotation (100%), our approaches outperform state-of-the-art full annotation segmentation methods on various 3D medical image segmentation tasks. Experimental results on different datasets demonstrate the practical applicability of our sparse annotation approaches.
