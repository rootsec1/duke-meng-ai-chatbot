Abstract
Deep learning has made significant progress in recent years, but real-life applications in medicine have been limited. Medical imaging, in particular, has proven to be more challenging than expected.

This talk will discuss a 7-year journey in developing deep learning methods for medical imaging, specifically for breast cancer screening. 
The speaker will explain how a deep learning model was created that can perform a diagnosis with an accuracy comparable to experienced radiologists. 
Novel neural network architectures and training methods were required to achieve this goal. 

The limitations of the work and potential advancements in the next few years will also be discussed.
