**ECE SEMINAR: Nowhere to Run, Nowhere to Hide: The Use of a Cognitive Biometric to Establish Identity in Cyberspace**


**Presenter:** Damon Woodard


**Date:** March 11, 2022


**Time:** 7:00 AM - 8:00 AM


**Abstract:**

Society relies on the internet for commerce and trusted communication. To thwart future cyber threats, a reliable means of establishing identity in cyberspace is crucial. Physiological-based biometrics are an irrefutable means of establishing identity in the physical world, but their use in cyberspace is limited.

This seminar discusses using a cognitive biometric modality - online text - to establish identity in cyberspace. The challenges of this method, including artificial intelligence-enabled authorship attribution, are explained. Advances in authorship attribution methods based upon natural language processing and text analytics are presented, resulting in a correct identification rate of nearly 90% for over 27,000 individuals. The presentation concludes with future research directions in related work.
