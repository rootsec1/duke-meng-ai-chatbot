**Abstract:**

In recent decades, computer models based on partial differential equations (PDEs) have become indispensable for science and engineering. However, significant gaps remain between these simulations and real-world phenomena, impairing their effectiveness in decision-making and design for complex systems like Mars landings.

To address this challenge, Dr. Huang has developed data-aware computational models that combine available data with complex PDE-based models for improved predictions and uncertainty quantification.

**Two Complementary Approaches:**

1. **Bayesian Method for Model Update and Uncertainty Quantification:**
   - Kalman inversion approach combines Kalman filtering with empirical convergence for Bayesian calibration with minimal model evaluations.

2. **Geometry-Aware Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) for Deep Learning Surrogate Modeling:**
   - Maps design geometry to predicted PDE solution state.
   - Uses deep learning's automatic differentiation tools to compute gradients for real-time multiphysics engineering design optimization.

**Applications:**
- Supersonic parachute for Mars landing
- Bacteria-resistant catheter design
- Digital twin for wing damage detection
- Earth system model for climate science
