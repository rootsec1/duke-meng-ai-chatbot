**Felipe Medeiros**

**Adjunct Professor of Ophthalmology**

Dr. Medeiros joined Duke Ophthalmology as Professor in August 2017. Prior to joining Duke, he was a full professor of ophthalmology at the UCSD School of Medicine where he held the Ben and Wanda Hildyard Endowed Chair for Diseases of the Eye. He also served as medical director of the Hamilton Glaucoma Center, University of California San Diego and director of the Visual Performance Laboratory at UCSD.

**Research**

His research focuses on the development of innovative methods to diagnose and detect glaucoma progression as well as on the assessment and prevention of functional impairment in the disease, the leading cause of blindness in the world. In his research, Dr. Medeiros evaluates the impact of eye diseases on activities of daily living, using innovative techniques such as virtual reality. His laboratory was the first to use virtual reality to predict a clinically relevant functional outcome in medicine. He has also concentrated on developing innovative brain-computer interfaces for objective and portable assessment of visual function in several diseases. His research has been funded by numerous federal and private grants. He is the principal investigator on a National Institutes of Health (NIH) R01 to evaluate functional impairment in glaucoma and on an NIH R21 for development of a new method for assessing functional loss in glaucoma.
