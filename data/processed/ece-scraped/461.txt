**Over half a million people lack access to clean water. That's one in 10 people on the planet.** Clean water is essential to the health of all living things-human, animal, plant, cellular. 

**What causes the contaminants in our water and ecosystems?** And, what are the related problems that affect our consumption, sanitation, and the larger environment? In this session, we will hear from Duke experts about the ways we are identifying pollutants, tracking their impact, and cleaning up water sources to improve health worldwide.
