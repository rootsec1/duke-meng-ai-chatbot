The application of artificial intelligence in health settings holds great potential, but there are many considerations and concerns for the safe and responsible integration of these powerful methods. In this one-hour virtual seminar, we'll discuss these considerations with 2 experts: Dr. Tcheng, who is an interventional cardiologist and clinical informaticist; and Dr. Carlson, who is a quantitative and machine learning expert; and Dr. Sperling, who is an expert in evaluation and applied/community-engaged research methods.

Through their complementary areas of expertise, we'll explore perspectives on the current state and future development of ethics and safety in cutting-edge AI methods and applications, with a particular focus on health and clinical settings.
