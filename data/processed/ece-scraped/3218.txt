Tuesday, December 8, 2020

7:00AM

Presenter:
Shayla Sawyer, Associate Professor in the Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering Department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute

**Professor Sawyer's Research**

* Bridging the gap between novel hybrid materials and their use in new sensor systems to detect hazards (biological, environmental, chemical, or nuclear)
* Investigating optical and electrical properties of:
    * Metal oxide semiconductor nanomaterials
    * Perovskites
    * Two-dimensional high mobility materials
    * Organic materials
* Forming hybrid material devices to exploit synergistic relationships and enhance optical and electrical characteristics
* Discovering unique properties of material combinations to create unprecedented responses to light and other surrounding media
* Integrating these materials in optical and electronic devices to convert responses to electrical signals for use in an increasingly interconnected digital world

**Applications**

* Sensing
* Bioremediation
* Energy harvesting

**Recent Explorations**

* Fabricating 2D nanomaterials at room temperature using bacteria
* Bio-fabrication as a versatile, low-energy alternative to other fabrication methods
