**Presenter:** Engineering Faculty Council

**Dear Colleagues and Pratt Community,**

We are deeply saddened by the sudden loss of Joseph Izatt, our colleague and Chair of Biomedical Engineering.

In light of this development, we have decided to cancel and reschedule the Pratt Faculty Meeting originally scheduled for Thursday, April 11, 2024. 

Out of respect for Joe's memory and to allow our community time to process this loss, we believe it is appropriate to pause our gathering. We hope you understand, and we will be in touch with further updates soon.

On behalf of our Engineering Faculty Council, I would also like to express our deepest condolences to his family, to our Duke BME community, and to all those who knew Professor Izatt.

In sadness and sympathy,
Volker Blum
EFC Chair 2023-24
