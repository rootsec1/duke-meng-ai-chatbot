**Time:** 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM

**Abstract:**
Science reveals patterns, regularity, and connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena. This event explores three examples centered on fluid mechanics that exhibit complex behavior and unveils the hidden patterns beneath the surface.

**Key Points:**

* **First Example:** Examining the similarities between dolphins, sharks, bony fish, birds, bats, and insects, despite their diverse appearances.
* **Second Example:** Introducing research suggesting the existence of universal structures in turbulence.
* **Third Example:** Discussing recent efforts to automate the process of scientific discovery to a certain extent.
* **Connecting Themes:** Exploring common threads that emerge across the examples.
