### Solar Energy and Photovoltaics
- Solar energy is a crucial component of decarbonizing the global energy sector.
- Widespread adoption of solar energy could intensify land competition.
- Hybrid materials, such as metal-halide perovskites, offer promising solutions for advancing photovoltaics.

### Perovskite Heterostructures
- Perovskite heterostructures can advance next-generation photovoltaics in two emerging directions:
  - Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) for land-saving integrated photovoltaics
  - High-efficiency tandem photovoltaics

### Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSCs)
- Design of perovskite heterostructures for LSCs involves the concept of narrowband exciton routing using phase-tuned self-assembled quantum wells.
- This approach enables low-loss perovskite-based LSCs with high internal quantum efficiency and large dimensions.

### Tandem Solar Cells
- Mixed-dimensional heterojunctions are developed to reduce the oxidation of tin-lead perovskite bottom cells.
- This leads to over 26%-efficiency all-perovskite tandem solar cells, exceeding the efficiency of single-junction perovskites for the first time.

### Commercialization Prospects 
- Interface engineering can enhance the performance of perovskite solar cells, but at the expense of high-temperature operating stability.
- Commercialization of high-efficiency tandem/triple-junction technologies require innovative solutions for stability breakthroughs.
- Sustainability challenges include replacing toxic solvents, minimizing lead leakage, and developing end-life recycling strategies.
