**ECE Distinguished Speaker Series: Weaving the Next Web with Spatial Computing**

**Date:** Friday, November 12, 2021
**Time:** 7:00AM - 8:00AM

**Presenter:** Anthony Rowe

**Abstract:**

The future of the Web is predicted to integrate Web content with the real world through augmented reality (AR). This overlay of virtual content on the physical world is called the Spatial Web or MetaVerse and offers vast potential to transform the Internet and its applications.

This talk will delve into mixed reality systems and introduce ARENA, a new Spatial Computing architecture developed by the CONIX Research Center. ARENA is a multi-user and multi-application environment that simplifies the development of mixed reality applications. It allows cross-platform interaction with 3D content generated in real-time by network-connected agents (human or machine). The architecture is network transparent, enabling users and data to execute and migrate seamlessly across various connected computing resources, including edge servers, in-network processing units, headsets, and mobile phones.

The talk will also discuss systems designed using ARENA with networked sensors and actuators for digitizing real-world environments. These projects highlight bottlenecks and challenges in developing immersive spatial computing systems.
