ECE Distinguished Speaker Series: Data Science against COVID-19

**Presenter:** Nuria Oliver

**Abstract:**

My talk will describe my work since March 2020 leading a multi-disciplinary team of 20+ volunteer scientists in collaboration with the Presidency of the Valencian Government in Spain. Our work has focused on four main areas:

1. Human mobility modeling
2. Computational epidemiological models
3. Predictive models
4. Citizen surveys via the COVID19impactsurvey with over 600,000 answers worldwide

I will discuss the results we have produced in each of these areas, including winning the 500K XPRIZE Pandemic Response Challenge and the best paper award at ECML-PKDD 2021. I will share lessons learned from this collaboration between civil society (through the survey), the scientific community (through the Expert Group), and public administration (through the Commissioner at the Presidency level).

**Biography:**

Nuria Oliver is:

* Co-founder and Vice-President of ELLIS (The European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems)
* Co-founder of the Alicante ELLIS Unit
* Chief Data Scientist at Data-Pop Alliance
* Chief Scientific Advisor at the Vodafone Institute

In March 2020, she was appointed Commissioner for the President of the Valencian Region on AI Strategy and Data Science to fight Covid-19, leading a team of over 20 data scientists. She also led the ValenciaIA4COVID team, which won the 500k XPRIZE Pandemic Response Challenge, the first time a Spanish team has won an XPRIZE competition.

Oliver has over 25 years of research experience in human behavior modeling and prediction from data and human-computer interaction. She has held research positions at:

* Microsoft Research (Redmond, WA)
* Telefonica R&D (Scientific Director for over 8 years)
* Vodafone (Director of Research in Data Science globally, 2017-2019)

Her work in computational modeling of human behavior using AI techniques, human-computer interaction, mobile computing, and Big Data analysis for social good is well-known. She has over 160 scientific publications with over 20,000 citations, ten best paper award nominations and awards, and is co-inventor of over 40 filed patents. She is a regular keynote speaker at international conferences.

Oliver's work has contributed to improving services, creating new services, defining business strategies, and establishing new companies. She is the only Spanish researcher recognized by the ACM as both a Distinguished Scientist (2015) and Fellow (2017). She is also a Fellow of:

* IEEE (2017)
* European Association for Artificial Intelligence (2016)

She has received an Honorary Doctorate from the Miguel Hernandez University (2018). Dr. Oliver is:

* The youngest and fourth female member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Engineering (2018)
* An elected member of the Academia Europaea (2016)
* A member of the CHI Academy (2018), where she is the only Spanish scientist

She graduated first in her class in Telecommunications Engineering from the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid and holds a PhD in Artificial Intelligence from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
