### Abstract:
Recent advancements in machine learning have opened up the potential for applications in autonomous systems. However, for safety-critical applications like agile robotic control in hazardous environments, several challenges must be addressed before widespread deployment.

The learning system must interact with the rest of the autonomous system (e.g., highly nonlinear and non-stationary dynamics) in a way that prevents catastrophic failures with formal guarantees. Additionally, from both computational and statistical perspectives, the learning system must incorporate prior knowledge for efficiency and generalizability.

This talk presents progress towards a unified framework that fundamentally connects learning and control.

First, Guanya Shi will discuss the benefits and necessity of such a unified framework using the Neural-Control Family, a family of nonlinear deep-learning-based control methods with stability and robustness guarantees and new capabilities in agile robotic control.

Then Guanya Shi will discuss two interfaces between learning and control in the unified framework:
1. Meta-adaptive control
2. Competitive control
