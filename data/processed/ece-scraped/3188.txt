Graph mining, which finds all embeddings matching specific patterns, is a fundamental task in many applications. 

In this talk, I will present the first graph mining system that decomposes the target pattern into several subpatterns, and then computes the count of each. The system addressed several key challenges including:

 * a partial-embedding-centric programming model supporting advanced graph mining applications
 * an accurate and efficient cost model based on approximate graph mining
 * an efficient search method to jointly determine the decomposition of all concrete patterns of an application
 * the partial symmetry breaking technique to eliminate redundant enumeration

Our experiments show that the system is significantly faster than all existing state-of-the-art systems and provides a novel and viable path to scale to large patterns. 

I will also introduce the instruction set extension and architectural supports for the key primitive, intersection, to accelerate graph mining algorithms.
