**Description:**

Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can enhance traditional screening methods to create a population-based strategy for identifying high-risk patients within large health systems. This includes identifying patients with poor physical function who may require early palliative care.

This seminar will explore the following topics:

1. Utilizing electronic health record (EHR) data for a data-driven approach to categorize patients with poor functional status
2. Applying unsupervised machine learning algorithms for clustering visualization of the data
3. Training and testing a supervised machine learning algorithm to differentiate between patient functional status types
4. Identifying features of EHR clinical data that predict functional status types
5. Evaluating the model for potential health inequities

Attendees will gain insights into current AI applications using health system EHR data and the initial steps for piloting the implementation of the model for population-based screening.
