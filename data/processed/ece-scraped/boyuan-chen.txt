Boyuan Chen

Assistant Professor in the Thomas Lord Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science

Boyuan Chen's research focuses on Robotics, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning, with a broader interest in AI for science. At Duke, he leads the General Robotics Lab.

He is interested in developing "generalist robots" that learn, act, and improve by perceiving and interacting with the complex and dynamic world.

He hopes that robots and machines can be equipped with high-level cognitive skills to assist people and unleash human creativity.

Boyuan Chen obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science at Columbia University with Hod Lipson.
