Xin Li

Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Professor Xin Li holds a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University (2005), and a M.S. and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Fudan University in Shanghai (2001 and 1998, respectively). 

Before joining Duke, Prof. Li co-founded Xigmix Inc. in 2005 to commercialize his Ph.D. research. He served as Chief Technical Officer until the company's acquisition by Extreme DA in 2007, which was later acquired by Synopsis in 2011. From 2009 to 2012, he served as Assistant Director of the Focus Research Center for Circuit & System Solutions (C2S2) at Carnegie Mellon University, and from 2014 to 2015, as Assistant Director of the Center for Silicon System Implementation (CSSI), also at Carnegie Mellon. 

Prof. Li's research interests focus on integrated circuits, signal processing, and data analytics. He has served as Associate Editor for numerous prominent journals in these fields, including IEEE Trans. on Biomedical Engineering (TBME), IEEE Trans. on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems (TCAD), ACM Trans. on Design Automation of Electronic Systems (TODAES), IEEE Design & Test (D&T), and Journal of Low Power Electronics (JOLPE). He has also served on several committees, including the Executive Committee of ACM Special Interest Group on Design Automation (SIGDA), the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society Technical Committee on Cybernetics for Cyber-Physical Systems (TCCCPS), and the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on VLSI (TCVLSI). 

Prof. Li has received numerous awards and honors for his research, including the NSF Faculty Early Career Development Award (CAREER) in 2012, two IEEE Donald O. Pederson Best Paper Awards in 2013 and 2016, the Best Paper Award from Design Automation Conference (DAC) in 2010, two IEEE/ACM William J. McCalla ICCAD Best Paper Awards in 2004 and 2011, and the Best Paper Award from International Symposium on Integrated Circuits (ISIC) in 2014.
