- Wanted to be able align studies at Duke with the current challenges facing the industry.
- Studying for a master's degree at Duke allowed me to do that.

### Tell us about your master's project
- Implemented a fully encrypted file system, with a focus on performance.
- Came up with a solution to decrease encryption/decryption latency by exploiting concurrency when possible.

### Why did you choose that topic?
- Was surprised to see that most of the well-known block cipher modes are sequential in nature in favor of security.
- Was motivated to explore alternative existing methods to encrypt by allowing parallelism without sacrificing security.

### What was the most surprising thing you learned?
- Realized that in most cases, the term "unbreakable encryption" pretty much means "just not enough time and hardware to break it."
