Two metamaterials researchers at Duke are manipulating light at the highest frequencies currently possible to enable applications such as precision agriculture and high-bandwidth communications.

**Birth of a New Field: Metamaterials**

The term "metamaterials" emerged in science news nearly 15 years ago when a Duke-led research team created the world's first invisibility cloak. Despite its limited capabilities, it marked the birth of a new field.

**Duke's Metamaterials Group**

Duke is now home to a burgeoning metamaterials group, led by Maiken Mikkelsen and Natalia Litchinitser. They are tackling challenges from precision agriculture to breaking bandwidth limits.

**Small Waves, Big Challenges**

Metamaterials are engineered to have properties beyond those provided by nature. To manipulate electromagnetic waves, these materials must have features smaller than the light's wavelength.

**Maiken Mikkelsen's Approach: Trapping Light**

Mikkelsen's approach uses sandwiches and nanocubes to trap light as plasmons on metal nanocubes. By precisely tailoring spacings, she can control the frequency of absorption or emission.

**Precision Agriculture Applications**

Mikkelsen is developing compact, lightweight hyperspectral cameras for precision agriculture. These cameras can identify plant types, conditions, and nutrient levels, enabling efficient resource allocation.

**Natalia Litchinitser's Approach: Twisting Light**

Litchinitser explores the use of orbital angular momentum (OAM) to enhance light communications. OAM creates swirling light vortexes.

**Breaking Bandwidth Bottlenecks**

OAM offers unique properties that can increase data transmission capacity. Researchers have developed a vortex laser with multiple OAM modes, enabling potentially five times more data transmission.

**Dynamically Tunable Vortex Laser**

Litchinitser devised a metamaterial filter that dynamically tunes a vortex laser's OAM modes. This innovation could revolutionize optical communications, computing, and encryption techniques.

**The Future of Metamaterials**

With the potential for transformative applications, metamaterials research is poised to continue expanding our understanding and capabilities in manipulating light.
