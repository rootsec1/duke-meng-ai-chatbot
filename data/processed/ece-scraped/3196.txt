**ATHENA SEMINAR**

**Dynamic Decentralized Federated Learning**

**Date:** Wednesday, April 6, 2022

**Time:** 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM

**Presenter:** Shenghong Dai, University of Wisconsin Madison

**Abstract:**

With vehicles increasingly equipped with data-collecting sensors, Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a way to train high-quality models leveraging such data while protecting client privacy. However, limitations arise when the central server becomes overwhelmed with a large client base. Decentralized FL addresses this by allowing clients to share model updates with neighboring clients instead.

Shenghong Dai presents a new decentralized FL algorithm that handles the challenges of dynamic data and connectivity graphs. Additionally, she introduces a realistic decentralized FL simulator that models the dynamic graph.
