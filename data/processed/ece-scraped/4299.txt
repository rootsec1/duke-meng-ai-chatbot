**Design, Modeling, and Control of Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgical Systems with Integrated Sensing**

**Presenter:** Nancy Deaton
**Date:** Thursday, April 4, 2024
**Time:** 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM

**Abstract:**

The manipulation of passive surgical tools for accessing locations deep within the body presents clinical challenges, such as the navigation of complex anatomy, the need for real-time device visualization, and the prevention of injury or perforation. This seminar explores the design, modeling, and control of robotic surgical systems to address these challenges.

**Part 1: Robotic Needle System for Brachytherapy**

* Development of a robotically steerable needle system for high-dose rate brachytherapy (HDR BT) treatment of prostate cancer
* Significance of precise needle placement for optimal radiation delivery and minimization of damage
* Presentation of system development and control for accurate HDR BT needle placement along various paths

**Part 2: Robotic Guidewires**

* Challenges in navigating tortuous vessels using non-steerable guidewires in endovascular interventions
* Prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and complexity in treating small, tortuous vasculature
* Development of a robotically steerable guidewire with integrated shape and force sensing
* Potential solution to address navigation challenges without causing harm to small vessels

**Conclusion:**

The seminar concludes by outlining future research directions, emphasizing the ongoing advancement of robotic tools and their potential to enhance minimally invasive surgery.
