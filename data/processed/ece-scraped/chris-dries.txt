**Background**

Chris Dries is a serial entrepreneur who started his career in the indium phosphide startup business and later ventured into silicon carbide, an emerging material for high-voltage power conversion. He grew up in Washington, D.C., where his father worked at the Naval Research Laboratory. This early exposure to hardware sparked his interest in physics and engineering.

**Duke Experience**

At Duke, Dries initially considered consulting or project management but was inspired by friends' entrepreneurial parents. He credits the social atmosphere and collaborative environment at Duke with fostering his personality traits and interest in business.

**Entrepreneurial Journey**

After graduating, Dries pursued a graduate fellowship at Princeton University. There, he met his advisor, Steve Forrest, who had a strong entrepreneurial streak. He also met Greg Olsen, a renowned entrepreneur in the Princeton area, who has been a long-time collaborator.

**Engineering Foundation**

Dries' dissertation focused on lasers and detectors in indium phosphide, a semiconductor used in fiber optic communication systems. He recognized the potential of this technology and started a successful business that sold in 2000, was bought back in 2002, and sold again in 2005.

**Silicon Carbide Venture**

Dries' engineering background enabled him to identify the potential of silicon carbide for high-voltage power conversion. He founded United Silicon Carbide Inc. based on his research in this area.

**Transformative Moments at Duke**

Dries recalls meeting his wife at Duke and two pivotal interactions with professors that made a lasting impact. One was a freshman year incident where he realized the importance of the professors' commitment to student success. The second was an offer of employment from Professor Bill Joines during his senior year, which provided financial support and research experience.

**Duke's Electrical Engineering Program**

As a member of Pratt's Board of Visitors, Dries believes that Duke's electrical engineering program is strong academically and has gained international recognition. He commends Dean Katsouleas' leadership and the university's focus on innovation and entrepreneurship.

**Advice for Future Entrepreneurs**

Dries advises aspiring entrepreneurs to consider gaining work experience or partnering with experienced business owners before starting their own ventures. He emphasizes the importance of mentorship and experience over pursuing immediate ideas.
