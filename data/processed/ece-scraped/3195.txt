ECE SEMINAR: Adversarial Machine Learning in the Real World

April 15, 2022 | 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM

Presenter: Emily Wenger

Abstract:
Recent years have seen the development of an arsenal of adversarial machine learning attacks and defenses for deep neural networks. However, the field is stuck in a cycle of new defenses being proposed, only to be broken by more powerful attacks. This talk suggests that a shift towards more realistic threat models is needed to break this cycle. Wenger presents her recent work on physical backdoor attacks and explains how more realistic threat models are changing the way people think about backdoor attacks against DNNs.
