**ECE SEMINAR**

**Title:** On Integrating Human-Centered Data in Design and Engineering Systems: Triumphs and Challenges

**Date:** Friday, November 6, 2020

**Time:** 7:00AM - 8:00AM

**Presenter:** Tahira Reid Smith, Associate Professor, School of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University

**Abstract:**
Engineers often tackle human-centered problems. Traditional engineering focuses on functionality, lacking tools to address the social and cultural aspects. However, the social sciences possess valuable tools for capturing and utilizing human-centered data. This talk showcases projects from the Research in Engineering and Interdisciplinary Design (REID) Lab, demonstrating how human-centered data has aided in defining and addressing novel engineering challenges in the automotive, hair care, and aeronautical industries.
