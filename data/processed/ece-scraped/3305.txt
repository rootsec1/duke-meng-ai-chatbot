**AI Health Spark Seminar Series: Machine Learning for Preclinical Behavioral Phenotyping and TBI Clinical Workflows**

**Date:** Tuesday, November 1, 2022

**Time:** 1:00PM - 2:00PM

**Presenter:**

* Timothy Dunn, PhD; Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Assistant Professor in Neurosurgery, Duke University
* Host: Maciej Mazurowski, PhD; Associate Professor in Radiology, Duke University

**Description:**

* Body movement is closely linked to brain health and can provide rich metrics for brain disorders and treatments.
* Computer vision tools for 3D movement (pose) quantification in individuals and social groups have been developed to bridge the gap in precise movement quantification.
* In lab rodents, these 3D behavioral measurements have been used to improve the sensitivity and throughout of preclinical drug and disease phenotyping.
* Progress is being made towards building brain CT image processing systems for traumatic brain injury clinical workflows.
