**Scaling Up Reconfigurable Atom Arrays for Quantum Simulation**

**Presenter:**

Huanqian Loh, National University of Singapore and the Centre for Quantum Technologies

**Abstract:**

Reconfigurable atom arrays are a promising platform for the scalable and programmable control of individual qubits for quantum computation and simulation. With these atom arrays, the internal and external quantum states, geometries, dimensionality, and doping can be arbitrarily engineered. Such wide tunability makes the atom array platform particularly attractive for performing quantum simulations, such as those of strongly correlated materials. Scaling up the atom arrays while maintaining high fidelity control would allow one to simulate more complex systems.

In this talk, I will discuss the limits of scaling up atom arrays and present two solutions to overcome these limits:

- The first involves a new class of "magic" wavelengths for optically confining the atoms.
- The second involves novel rearrangement algorithms to rapidly assemble defect-free arrays of hundreds of atoms in real time.

I will also discuss different routes to inducing programmable interactions, with an eye towards future quantum simulation studies.
