Dear Colleagues,

It has been a busy year for Duke Engineering. We have appointed Jerome Lynch as our new Vinik Dean. The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering has established multiple new research centers:

* NSF AI Institute for Edge Computing Leveraging Next Generation Networks
* Air Force Research Laboratory/Air Force Office of Scientific Research University Center of Excellence focusing on agile waveform design for communication networks in contested environments
* A Department of Defense MURI center supporting metasurface-enabled imaging systems
* The NSF-funded Alliance for Identity-Inclusive Computing Education (AIICE).

The Duke ECE has a strong entrepreneurial culture and offers many resources for students and faculty to translate their research into products and services for the public. Recently, IonQ, a Duke ECE spinoff and the world's first pure-play quantum computing company, went public on the New York Stock Exchange. Two of our faculty members, Chris Monroe and Jungsang Kim, joined IonQ president Peter Chapman for the bell ringing ceremony.

We are proud that our startups have grown from the work of our brilliant Duke ECE community.

Sincerely,
Krishnendu Chakrabarty
John Cocke Distinguished Professor and Chair
