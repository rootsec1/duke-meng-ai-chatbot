Research Interests

Professor Brady's research focuses on "smart cameras" which use artificial intelligence to increase the amount of visual information captured and to render this information useful. In 2012 his group built the world's first gigapixel camera, his work today focuses on making gigapixel media and interactive virtual reality broadcasting ubiquitous.
