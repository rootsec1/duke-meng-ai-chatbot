## ATHENA SEMINAR SERIES: Computer Architectures for Mind-Machine Teaming

### Presenter: Dr. Abhishek Bhattacharjee, Yale University

### Date and Time:
- Friday, February 3, 2023
- 12:00PM - 1:00PM EST
- Via Zoom

### Abstract:
Direct brain-computer communication offers potential for treating neurological disorders, explaining brain function, and enhancing human cognition and decision-making. To realize this potential, computer systems must be designed to balance power, latency, and bandwidth requirements for decoding brain activity, stimulating neurons, and controlling devices effectively.

This talk will present two systems that enable brain-computer interactions:

- **HALO:** An accelerator-rich processing fabric for flexible single-brain-site interfacing at high data rates with low power consumption.
- **Hull:** A distributed system of networked HALO fabrics for multi-brain-site interfacing.

The talk will explore research questions related to the design and integration of hardware accelerators, co-design with networking and storage stacks, and programming interfaces. Insights from two chip tape-outs, including one in a 12nm CMOS process, will be shared.
