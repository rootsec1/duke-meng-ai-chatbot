**Overview:**

Robots must behave safely and reliably for real-world deployment. To achieve this, they must manage a complex autonomy stack of perception, planning, and control software.

**Challenges:**

* Machine learning methods for end-to-end control can be unreliable.
* Model-based safety-critical control provides guarantees but struggles to scale to real systems with imperfect task specifications and perception.

**Approach:**

An end-to-end approach to safety-critical control that leverages learned components can build practical and rigorous algorithms for reliable robots.

**Key Points:**

* Learning hard constraints from human task demonstrations to simplify task specification and enhance safety.
* Safe planning with learned specifications despite uncertainty.
* Reliable leveraging of learned dynamics and perception for planning and control by estimating model accuracy.
* Probabilistic guarantees for end-to-end vision-based control.

**Future Opportunities:**

* Robust perception-based hybrid control algorithms for reliable robotic manipulation.
* Human-robot collaboration.
