**Description:**

Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), holds promise for enhancing clinical decision support in healthcare. However, widespread adoption of AI has remained limited due to concerns about trust.

This seminar will discuss recent developments in quantitative explainable AI, trust quantification, data improvements, and best practices for trusted AI. Example use cases will showcase how these principles enable the building of trusted AI solutions for healthcare.

**Part of the Monthly Seminar Series:**

Organized by Spark: AI Health Initiative for Medical Imaging, this seminar series highlights outstanding work in medical imaging at Duke and beyond. Recordings are publicly available.
