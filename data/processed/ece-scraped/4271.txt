**DMI/MEMS Seminar**

**Presenter:** Prof. Yan Yao

**Date:** Wednesday, April 3, 2024

**Time:** 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM

**Abstract:**

All-solid-state batteries hold promise as future energy storage technologies, potentially superior to current Li-ion batteries. However, all-solid-state metal batteries still face challenges in performance.

This seminar will explore the key challenges confronting all-solid-state batteries, from understanding failure mechanisms to manufacturing issues. Multimodal tools are crucial for quantifying voids and dendrites, identifying chemical and mechanical properties, and monitoring processes in situ.

The seminar will also highlight materials innovations, such as soft organic redox materials that facilitate interfacial contact with solid electrolytes. The development of an oxysulfide glass electrolyte that forms a self-limiting interphase against Na metal will be discussed.

Additionally, research on interlayers between lithium metal anodes and solid electrolytes to prevent dendrite formation and enable reversible lithium plating and stripping over 2500 cycles will be presented.

Finally, the seminar will discuss ongoing efforts in battery manufacturing and the establishment of a battery prototyping facility at UH.
