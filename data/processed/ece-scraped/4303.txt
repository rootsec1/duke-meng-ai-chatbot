Presenter: Steve Wong

**Abstract**
The healthcare sector is facing a number of challenges, including escalating costs, regulatory complexities, growing patient expectations, health disparities, aging demographics, and the burden of chronic diseases. However, there is also great potential for using advanced technologies and the exponential growth of data across healthcare domains to improve patient care.

In this talk, Dr. Wong will present three distinct use cases in medicine where AI is being used to address some of these challenges:

1. Drug Discovery and Tumor-Stromal Interactions: Exploring AI's role in identifying novel therapeutic targets.
2. Cancer Diagnostics: Addressing the reduction of unnecessary biopsies through enhanced AI-driven diagnostics.
3. Acute Stroke Management: Improving acute stroke response times and accessibility.

Through these investigations, Dr. Wong aims to spark a dialogue on cognitive automation's capacity to transform medicine. The implications of successful AI integration extend far beyond technological advancement, posing fundamental questions about the evolution of the physician's role, the dynamics of the patient-physician relationship, and the overall patient experience.
