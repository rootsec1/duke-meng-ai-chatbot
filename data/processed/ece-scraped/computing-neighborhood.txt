**Welcome to the Neighborhood**

October 8, 2021

The fourth floor of Duke Engineering's new Wilkinson Building houses the Advanced Computing and Intelligent Systems research neighborhood.

**The Wilkinson Building**

The new 150,000-square-foot Wilkinson Building sits at the intersection of the Schools of Engineering, Medicine and Arts & Sciences. The Wilkinson Building's research "neighborhoods" bring together faculty with diverse specialties and areas of expertise, facilitating collaboration and cooperation.

The fourth floor is home to the Advanced Computing and Intelligent Systems neighborhood, where faculty with electrical and computer engineering, computer science, and mechanical engineering affiliations come together to develop solutions to challenges in AI and machine learning, robotics, cybersecurity and beyond.
