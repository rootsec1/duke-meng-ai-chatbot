ECE SEMINAR: Bidirectional Backpropagation and High Capacity Networks

April 29, 2022
8:00 AM - 9:00 AM

Presenter: Olaoluwa Adigun

Abstract:
My research has reformulated and extended modern deep neural networks to help them scale so that they can learn and recall more patterns. These new research results (1) extend ordinary unidirectional backpropagation to the more general case of bidirectional backpropagation (and allow noise-boosting as well), (2) replace the current ReLU hidden neuron with a nonvanishing perturbed-logistic activation that we call the NoVa hidden neuron, and (3) replace current single-block neural architectures with a multi-block structure that uses random coding and logistic output neurons rather than softmax output neurons at a block's output layer.
