In this talk, we will present the recent progress on doped HfO2 based ferroelectric devices.

First, we will discuss fundamental device physics including:
- minor loop switching and history effect
- drain-erase scheme
- variability and scalability of ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET)
- Machine learning assisted predictive modeling framework for phase variation

Second, we will present compute-in-memory (CIM) paradigm for deep neural network acceleration.

For MB-level image classification workloads, a new concept on ferroelectric non-volatile capacitor (nvCap) for charge-domain computing is proposed, and the related capacitive crossbar array is experimentally demonstrated. Hybrid synapse that combines charging/discharging mechanism and non-volatile storage is proposed for in-situ training.

For GB-level bioinformatics workloads, 3D NAND architecture based on FeFET is proposed for implementing hyperdimensional computing with heterogeneous integration.
