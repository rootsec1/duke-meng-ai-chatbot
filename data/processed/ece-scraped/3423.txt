**Abstract:**

Longitudinal digital health studies combine data from digital devices and patient-reported data. While ubiquitous adoption of smartphones and internet access supports large-scale studies, challenges exist in collecting representative data due to low adherence, engagement, and regularity in study tasks. These challenges can result in a non-representative study population, potentially leading to AI tools that fail to generalize in real-world deployments and may not serve underrepresented and underserved communities.

This seminar will present the speaker's research group's experience in conducting longitudinal digital health studies for COVID-19 monitoring, highlighting the challenges in collecting data from a representative population. The speaker will share how the team developed a guideline to mitigate demographic imbalance in bring-your-own-device (BYOD) design-based digital health studies. Additionally, the speaker will discuss the development of a machine learning-based intelligent allocation method for COVID-19 diagnostic testing in resource-limited settings using data collected during the CovIdentify study.

The seminar is accessible to a broad audience, including those with no prior background in health data science or artificial intelligence.
