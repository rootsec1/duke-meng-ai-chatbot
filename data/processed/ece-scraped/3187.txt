**ECE SEMINAR: Batteries Not Included: Reimagining Computing for the Next Trillion Devices**


**Abstract:**
For decades, smart devices have relied primarily on battery power, which are bulky, expensive, and not sustainable. Battery-free, energy-harvesting smart devices have emerged in the past decade for passive, invisible, and long-term sensing tasks. These devices compute intermittently, losing power, harvesting energy, and restoring computational state. This new paradigm requires rethinking hardware, software, and evaluation techniques.

This talk outlines approaches to enabling timely, performant, and correct execution of applications in memory and energy-scarce contexts. It discusses future research directions in intermittent computing and the battery-free IoT, including sophisticated inference tasks, embedding spintronic architecture, and simplifying program interfaces. Additionally, applications and demonstrations of this computing paradigm will be presented, including work on soil-powered sensors, smart face masks, and the world's first battery-free Nintendo Game Boy.
