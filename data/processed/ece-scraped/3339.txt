**Abstract:**

Patterns of altered brain white matter strongly correlate with neurological disease progression and may serve as early markers for future cognitive changes. Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) has been routinely included in national-scale neuroimaging studies of Alzheimer's Disease and aging. However, quantitative investigation of DW-MRI data is hindered by a lack of consistency and difficulty of interpretation of potential biomarkers.

In this seminar, we will discuss image analysis approaches to robustly characterize microstructural, macrostructure, and connectivity. We will highlight the consistent advantages of data-driven approaches for interpretation of DW-MRI at all levels.

**Key Topics:**

* Image acquisition
* Signal modeling
* Image analysis
* Microstructural, macrostructure, and connectivity
* Diffusion MRI deep learning techniques
* Robust and reproducible biomarkers

**Note:** This seminar is part of the monthly seminar series organized by Spark: AI Health Initiative for Medical Imaging. The seminar recordings will be publicly available.
