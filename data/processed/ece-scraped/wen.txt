**Q&A: Wei Wen**

**Introduction**
Wei Wen is a PhD student researching deep learning models under the guidance of Hai "Helen" Li, Co-Director of the Duke Center for Evolutionary Intelligence.

**Why Deep Learning Popularity**
* Achieves human-level prediction accuracy in computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and games.
* Advancements in labeled data availability, powerful hardware (GPUs), and improved understanding of neural networks.

**Practical Applications of Deep Learning Research**
* Computer vision: Detection and classification of images and videos (self-driving cars)
* Natural language processing: Recommendation systems (online shopping)
* Speech recognition: Translation between languages

**Research Projects**
**Training Phase**
* Reduce communication time during parallel training across multiple servers (from hours to minutes).

**Inference Phase**
* Compress large models for faster task execution, reduced energy consumption, and efficient deployment on small devices (mobile devices, drones, self-driving cars).

**Daily Routine**
* Reading papers
* Programming
* Implementing ideas
* Group meetings
* Discussions with professors and students
* Teaching assistant duties for "Introduction to Deep Learning"

**Industry Internships**
* Microsoft Research: Improving deep learning inference efficiency in the Cloud.
* Facebook Research: Efficient training in the Cloud and contributions to open source AI frameworks.

**Future Plans**
* Explore options in industry or academia.
* Continue research in understanding how machine learning systems work, particularly in medical imaging where models may identify diseases but lack explainability.

**Strengths of Duke PhD Program**
* Access to world-renowned experts in the field.
* Proximity to the Research Triangle, fostering collaboration and research culture.
