**Abstract:**

Light-responsive materials have immense applications in renewable energy, recyclable catalysis, and nanomaterial engineering. Photo-switching of molecules is a well-studied phenomenon in dilute solutions, but understanding the process in condensed liquid or solid environments is paramount for practical applications.

This presentation sheds light on the design principles of optically-controllable materials integrating organic photoswitches. Extensive studies of photochromic core structures and functional groups reveal the structure-property relationship of these stimuli-responsive materials.

Additionally, the talk explores applications of photo-controlled materials in solar photon and thermal energy storage, as well as sustainable catalysis.
