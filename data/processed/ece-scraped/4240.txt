Title:
Nano-optics for smart sensing and display

Abstract:
Nano-optical systems provide unprecedented control of light. These systems are ultra-compact and lightweight, enabling new optical functionalities beyond conventional optics. In this talk, I will focus on two applications: multifunctional metasurfaces for efficient computational depth sensors; and photonic integrated circuits (PICs) for high-performance laser displays. The combination of nano-optics with computational approaches and active platforms will be discussed. These examples demonstrate the potential of nano-optics in enabling the next generation of smart sensors and displays, particularly for small, low-power platforms such as augmented reality devices, internet of things (IoT), and more.

Bio:
Zhujun Shi is currently an optical research scientist at Reality Labs at Meta. Prior to that, she was a research assistant in Prof. Federico Capasso's group at Harvard University. Her research focuses on nanophotonics and nano-optics. By engineering the interaction of light and structured materials at the subwavelength scale, she develops nano-optical systems for various imaging, sensing and display applications.
