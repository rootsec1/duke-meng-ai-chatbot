**Overview**:

The precision of optical atomic clocks allows for the detection of small deviations from the Standard Model, providing a complementary tool to particle accelerators in the search for beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics. Frequency ratio measurements between atomic clocks based on Al+, Hg+, Sr, and Yb atoms are used to constrain the coupling of ultralight scalar dark matter candidates to the Standard Model.

Quantum-logic spectroscopy techniques developed for Al+ clocks have enabled quantum control and precision measurements of molecular ions with various applications.

New experiments at UCLA in Los Angeles, California based on different atomic, molecular, and nuclear transitions are being set up with higher sensitivity to BSM physics in various sectors.
