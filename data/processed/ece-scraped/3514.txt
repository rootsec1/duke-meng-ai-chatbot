**Turbulent Drag Reduction Using Dynamic Free-Slip Surfaces**

**Presenter:** Cong Wang

**Abstract:**

Wall-bounded turbulent flow is a critical factor in the performance of transportation systems. Understanding and reducing drag in this context is a long-standing challenge.

This talk introduces a novel dynamic free-slip surface method that can reduce turbulent drag force by over 40%. The method employs an array of air-water interfaces attached to the wall boundary, which dynamically oscillate at specific frequencies and amplitudes.

The dynamic free-slip surfaces alter momentum and energy transfer within the turbulent flow, effectively lifting vorticity and shear motions away from the wall boundary. This results in a counterintuitive local propulsion force.

Additionally, an analysis of the energy exchange process shows that turbulent flow near the wall boundary partially re-laminarizes through an inverted energy cascade process. These observations support the substantial drag reduction effect.
