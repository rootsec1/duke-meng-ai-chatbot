**Systems Engineering Theory is a Scientific Theory**

**Presenter:** Eric Feron
Robotics, Intelligent Systems, and Control Laboratory (RISClab), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology

**Abstract:**
Systems engineering plays a critical role in various contexts. Motivated by challenges and failures in complex systems, this talk proposes a theory of complex systems engineering. This theory views engineered systems as un-invalidated scientific hypotheses arising from a combination of mathematical and experimental constructs. 

**Arguments for the Theory:**
* Manufactured, un-invalidated scientific hypotheses from mathematical theorems
* Arguments in favor of the theory
* Practical consequences in complex system design and future research

**Evaluation:**
* Limited experiments to invalidate the theory through existing educational programs
* Argument for a lack of education in mathematics and engineering science in engineering programs
