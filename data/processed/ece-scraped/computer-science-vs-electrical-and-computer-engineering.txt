**What's the Difference Between Computer Science and Electrical & Computer Engineering?**

By John A. Board, PhD

**Introduction**

Students considering a career in computing often seek clarification on the distinction between computer engineering (CompE) and computer science (CompSci). Duke University's undergraduate curriculum further highlights this relationship.

**Interdisciplinary Environment at Duke**

Duke fosters a unique interdisciplinary environment with faculty members holding appointments in both Computer Engineering and Computer Science.

**Philosophical and Practical Differences**

**Computer Science (CompSci)**

* Focuses on theoretical underpinnings of computation
* Courses include programming, algorithms, numerical analysis, and theory of computation
* Originated from mathematics departments, emphasizing rigorous mathematical foundations

**Computer Engineering (CompE)**

* Emphasizes practical aspects of computers
* Courses include digital logic design and processor interfacing, building on knowledge of electronics and circuits
* Closely tied to solid state physics and devices programs, delving into integrated circuit manufacturing
* Developed in engineering departments with strong electrical engineering foundations

**Overlapping Areas**

* Computer architecture
* Operating systems

**Duke's Innovative Approach**

* Offers a major in the hybrid discipline of Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE)
* Emphasizes traditional electrical engineering subjects (e.g., electromagnetics, signal processing)
* Produces students well-prepared to integrate computing systems into real-world applications

**Collaboration Between ECE and CompSci**

* Many Duke faculty hold appointments in both departments
* ECE majors frequently pursue a second major in CompSci
* Jointly developed second major program designed for a four-year timeframe
* Provides students with a comprehensive understanding of computing, hardware, and traditional electrical engineering

**Conclusion**

Duke's hybrid ECE major prepares students for the integration of computing systems into innovative devices and products.
