Carlo Manfredini, R & D Director, Emona Tims

Abstract:
- Being able to complete hands-on laboratory classwork when away from the lab due to Covid or time and travel limitations is an important capability to offer to students.
- Allowing students to complete their lab sessions 24/7 and at their own pace is shown to complement and enhance their overall laboratory performance.
- Up to 6 different platforms located in Australia will be accessed & demonstrated live and participants are invited to also access them during the live demonstration.
- Each platform supports up to 60 students simultaneously as the hardware/server combination time-shares itself with multiple users at once.
- The system, netCIRCUITlabs, is currently operating worldwide and is the subject of several research studies.
