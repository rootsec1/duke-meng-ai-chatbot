Yiyang Gong is an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Duke University. His research interests include recording and understanding brain activity by developing novel combinations of optical microscopy and genetically encoded sensors. His goal is to use these technologies to dissect neural circuit function and investigate how neural activity drives complex behaviors. He has taught courses in Optics and Photonics Seminar Series, Bioelectricity, Projects in Engineering, and Modern Neuroscience Tools.

Some of his notable achievements include developing a fluorescent voltage sensor that can record neural spikes in awake mice and flies 2000 times faster than a blink of an eye, and using genetically encoded tools to target specific neuron types or specific projection pathways for recording or perturbation. His research has been recognized with several awards, including two NIH Innovator Awards.
