**ECE Seminar: In-Memory Computing: From Devices to Applications - A Cross-Layer Perspective**

**Date:** May 9, 2022

**Time:** 7:00 AM - 8:00 AM

**Presenter:** X. Sharon Hu, Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame

**Abstract:**

In-memory computing (IMC) is an effective alternative to address the bottleneck of data transfer between processors and memory in traditional computing hardware. However, harnessing the benefits of IMC requires cross-layer efforts spanning from devices and circuits to architectures and systems.

This talk will showcase several representative cross-layer IMC based design efforts, highlighting how different non-volatile device technologies can be exploited to implement various IMC functions and the unique challenges in designing IMC circuits and architectures. IMC solutions for popular machine learning and other applications will be analyzed to reveal the benefits contributed by each design layer.
